# Siamese Network using EfficientNet
## Overview
This repository contains code for implementing a Siamese Network architecture using EfficientNet as the backbone. Siamese Networks are a type of neural network architecture that can learn similarity metrics, useful for tasks such as face verification, signature verification, and more.

EfficientNet is a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architecture designed to be both efficient and accurate. This project leverages EfficientNet for feature extraction in the Siamese Network framework.

## Features
- Siamese Network Architecture: Implements the Siamese Network for metric learning.
- EfficientNet Backbone: Uses EfficientNet as the feature extractor.
- Custom Loss Function: Includes a custom loss function suitable for Siamese Networks.
- Training and Evaluation Scripts: Provides scripts for training and evaluating the model.

Requirements
To run this project, you need to have the following Python packages installed:

- TensorFlow >= 2.0
- Keras >= 2.3
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
(Other dependencies listed in requirements.txt)
You can install the required packages using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Getting Started

Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aditya-kamatt/Siamese-Network-using-EfficientNet.git
cd Siamese-Network-using-EfficientNet
```

## Prepare Your Data
Ensure your dataset is organized into appropriate directories for training and testing. This project expects images to be stored in directories with labels corresponding to their classes.

## Training the Model
To train the model, use the following command:
```bash
python train.py --data_dir /path/to/your/data --epochs 20 --batch_size 32
```

## Evaluating the Model
After training, you can evaluate the model with:
```bash
python evaluate.py --data_dir /path/to/your/data
```
## Testing the Model
To test the model on new image pairs, use:
```bash
python test.py --image1 /path/to/image1 --image2 /path/to/image2
```
